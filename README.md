Addressey
=========

I used Addressey as an opportunity to work with AngularJS and Firebase. I've created a simple tool that allows you to create address book contacts and look them up.

Functionality:
  - Using Firebase Authentication: register, login, reset password
  - CRUD operations
  - Click a contact for more details
  - Filtering through contacts if your contacts list is very large
  - All displaying in realtime through Firebase in a SPA (single page application)
