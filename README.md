Addressey
=========

I used Addressey as an opportunity to work with AngularJS and Firebase again. I've created a simple tool that allows you to create address book contacts and look them up.

Functionality:
  - Using Firebase Authentication: register, login, reset password
  - Create contacts
  - Edit contacts
  - Delete contacts
  - Click a contact for more details
  - Filtering through contacts if your contacts list is very large
  - All displaying in realtime through Firebase in a SPA (single page application)

What's left to to:
  - Make the user's login email (displayed on top right) persist through a refresh
  - Code Clean up/file structure clean up
  - Firebase security rules
  - Any CSS edits (very basic boostrap elements in place)

Beyond the list of what is left to do, this actually functions pretty well and is quite speedy.
